The data of your MySQL Server has been stolen and encrypted. 

Check your '/decrypt_me' folder, for the encrypted data and decryption script.
However you will need the unique key saved in a txt file.

In order to get the key, and therefore your data back you must send a payment in crypto to:

RANDOM_CRYPTO_ACCOUNT

You have 3 days to send payment otherwise your data will remain
encrypted forever and a copy will be sold to a third party.

If you send payment an encryption key will be sent to recover your files, 
with further instructions to perform decryption.

P.S. This is an educational example.
